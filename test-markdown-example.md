# Content Creation Framework

## 1. Main Idea / Angle (Step 2)

Take your core insight and give it a specific angle to form one main idea. Remember: "One post equals one idea." Act like a journalist, taking information and giving it an angle to tell a story.

## 2. Structure and Format (Step 3)

Use a good structure and format because people skim posts. Examples include:
- Carousels
- Infographics  
- Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS) framework
- Storytelling formats

---

This formatting will render in the chat with:
- **H1 header** "Content Creation Framework" with gradient blue text and ðŸ“Œ icon
- **H2 headers** for each numbered point with blue color and â–¸ arrow
- Clean unordered list with animated blue dots
- Horizontal rule separator at the bottom
