    "content": "Today, at Microsoft Build we showed you how we are building the open agentic web.\u00a0It is reshaping every layer of the stack, and our goal is simple: help every dev build apps and agents that empower people and orgs everywhere.\u00a0Here are 5 big things we announced today: \n\n1. Coding agent:\u00a0We are taking GitHub Copilot from being a pair programmer to peer programmer. You now have a full coding agent built right into GitHub.\u00a0You can assign it issues \u2013 whether it\u2019s bug fixes, new features, or ongoing code maintenance.\u00a0And it will complete these tasks autonomously. \n\n2. Copilot tuning:\u00a0Copilot can now learn your company\u2019s unique tone and language. It is all about taking that expertise you have as a firm and further amplifying it so everyone has access.\n\n3. Agent factory:\u00a0Foundry is the complete app platform for building apps and agents. We are adding support for more models from Grok, Hugging Face, Meta, Mistral, and more. Plus: Agentic retrieval in Azure AI Search, Foundry Agent Service, integration with Copilot Studio, and more.\u00a0 \n\nAnd we are ensuring the tools you already use for identity, management, and security will now all extend to agents too. \n\n4. NL Web: This is a new open project that lets you use natural language to interact with any website. Think of it like HTML for the agentic web.\n \n5. Microsoft Discovery: We\u2019re bringing together the full tech stack to help speed up science itself. Discovery uses agents to generate ideas, simulate results, and learn. A great example is this promising candidate for a coolant that doesn\u2019t rely on forever chemicals.\n\nYou can read more about all of this \u2013 and much more \u2013 here:  https://lnkd.in/gik2mTNb",

    "content": "It\u2019s been a busy few weeks \u2013 between today\u2019s earnings and some of our recent announcements. Here are a few things I wanted to highlight:\n\nWe are riding multiple compounding S curves in pre-training, inference time, and systems design, driving model performance that is doubling every 6 months. \n\nAzure is the infrastructure layer for AI, optimized across every layer: DCs, silicon, systems software, and models to lower costs and increase performance. We are delivering more performance per megawatt, lower cost per token, and faster dock-to-live times. \n\nFrontier firms are incorporating AI into everyday workflows, transforming work and work artifacts. Microsoft 365 Copilot is now being used by hundreds of thousands of customers across industries, up 3X year-over-year. \n\nI\u2019m especially excited about our new Researcher and Analyst agents, like having a highly trained expert on call 24/7.\n\nAnd our customers have created over 1 million agents of their own using SharePoint and Copilot Studio.\n\nOn the consumer side: Our ad revenue surpassed $20 billion over the past year. Only at Microsoft could that almost get overlooked!\n\nLinkedIn continues to grow fast, with double-digit membership gains. And we again took share across Bing and Edge. And we are building daily engagement and successful sessions with our Copilot app, which got a big update earlier this month.\n\nAnd, yes, blocks can be stars: Minecraft weekly active users jumped 75% year-over-year after the movie release. \n\nYou can read more about our results here: https://lnkd.in/gjWnuT9H",

    "content": "Big day for Microsoft 365 Copilot: I\u2019m really excited about our latest update. Copilot has truly become the UI for AI \u2013 and for me, it\u2019s the scaffolding for my workday. Here are four new features I\u2019ve especially been enjoying:\n\n1) Agents: Our new Researcher and Analyst agents have become my go-to 24/7 experts. I use them all the time.\n\nWith Researcher, the multi-step reasoning aggregates and synthesizes information from the web and all enterprise data and creates super insightful reports on any topic or project. \n\nAnd Analyst can turn raw data across multiple sources into deep insights, forecasts or a great visualization. \n\nWith our new Agent Store, you can easily find a range of additional agents from our many partners too. \n\nAnd with Copilot Studio you can create your own agents. It\u2019s as straightforward as creating a Word doc or Excel sheet.\n\n2) Notebooks: With Web + Work + Pages, you can ideate with AI and collaborate with other people. It has entirely changed my workflow. \n\nAnd now with Notebooks, I can organize all of my heterogeneous data for a project, whether it\u2019s Pages, docs, websites, team meetings \u2013 and Copilot will ground itself just on that content. \n\nAnd this might be the best part: I can turn it all into a new modality like an audio overview.\n\nFor example, I can collect all the latest things I\u2019m reading about agents and agent frameworks, and then I can listen to it.\n\n3) Search: We have added new comprehensive search capability that spans all your apps, including third-party sources from ServiceNow to Google Drive, Slack, Confluence, Jira, and more, breaking down silos across the enterprise.\n\nSearch brings back both a Copilot answer, as well as all of the source data from all of these artifacts. \n\n4) Create: This one is fun. Turn a PowerPoint into an explainer video, or generate an image from a prompt in Copilot with just a few clicks.\n\nWe\u2019ve also added new features to make Copilot even more personalized to you, plus a redesigned app built for human-agent collaboration.\n\nLearn more about our update here:\u00a0https://lnkd.in/g_FGnKZA",

    "content": "A couple reflections on the quantum computing breakthrough we just announced...\n\nMost of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed.\n\nAfter a nearly 20 year pursuit, we\u2019ve created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing.\n\nIt powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core.\n\nWe believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years. \n\nThe qubits created with topoconductors are faster, more reliable, and smaller. \n\nThey are 1/100th of a millimeter, meaning we now have a clear path to a million-qubit processor. \n\nImagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not! \n\nSometimes researchers have to work on things for decades to make progress possible.\n\nIt takes patience and persistence to have big impact in the world. \n\nAnd I am glad we get the opportunity to do just that at Microsoft. \n\nThis is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe. \n\nIt\u2019s not about hyping tech; it\u2019s about building technology that truly serves the world. \n\nRead more about our discovery, and why it matters, here: https://aka.ms/AAu76rr",

While these insights offer a valuable initial overview, they remain preliminary and require on-the-ground verification for a comprehensive understanding of the damage.\n\nThe AI for Good Lab remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting affected communities during this challenging time. \n\nIf your organization would benefit from access to the underlying data in this report, please reach out to me.
