## üî• First Post - Ready to Copy

```
6 months ago, I made a decision that changed my career trajectory.

After 10 years in cybersecurity, I took a sabbatical to master AI.

Not because it was trendy.
But because I saw how AI could transform the very systems I was protecting.

9 months later, I've:
‚Üí Built 7 AI agents from scratch
‚Üí Automated workflows saving 80% time
‚Üí Mastered Claude Code, Windsurf, and 5+ AI platforms
‚Üí Created secure AI solutions that actually work

The journey taught me:
1. AI isn't about replacing humans - it's about amplifying human potential
2. Security expertise is crucial for trustworthy AI
3. The best time to pivot is when you're ready to commit fully

Now I help businesses implement AI that delivers real ROI.

What transformation are you planning for 2025?
