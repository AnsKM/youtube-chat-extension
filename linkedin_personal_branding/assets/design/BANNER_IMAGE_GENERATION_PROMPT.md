## Alternative Simpler Prompt (if the above is too detailed):

```
Create a LinkedIn banner (1584x396px) for an AI consultant who transitioned from cybersecurity. Use deep blue (#1E3A8A), emerald green (#059669), and orange (#F59E0B) colors. Show a visual transformation from security (lock icon) to AI (neural network). Include text: "Transforming Business Through Secure AI Solutions" and "From Cybersecurity to AI Innovation". Modern, minimalist style with tech elements. Leave space on left for profile photo overlay.
```

## For Best Results:

1. **If using DALL-E 3**: Use the detailed prompt for better results
2. **If using Midjourney**: Add "--ar 4:1 --v 6" at the end for correct aspect ratio
3. **If using Canva AI**: Use the simpler prompt and adjust manually

## After Generation:

1. Download the highest resolution available
2. Check text readability at 50% zoom
3. Ensure the left area isn't too busy (profile photo will overlay)
4. Test on both desktop and mobile LinkedIn views

## Backup Option - Text Overlay Instructions:

If the AI doesn't generate text well, generate without text and add it manually:

```
Generate a LinkedIn banner background (1584x396px) showing abstract transformation from cybersecurity (lock/shield icons) to AI (neural networks). Use blue (#1E3A8A), green (#059669), and orange (#F59E0B) accent colors. Modern minimalist tech style with geometric patterns and data flow visualization. No text needed - I'll add it later.
```

Then add text using:
- Canva
- Figma
- Adobe Express
- PowerPoint

Font recommendations:
- Headers: Inter Bold or Poppins Bold
- Subtitle: Inter Regular
- Size: Large enough to read on mobile

## Pro Tips:

1. Generate 3-4 variations and pick the best
2. If text is unclear, generate without text and add manually
3. Ensure the "transformation" story is visually clear
4. Keep it professional - you're targeting business decision makers
5. The banner should complement, not compete with, your profile photo

Good luck with your banner creation! ðŸš€
