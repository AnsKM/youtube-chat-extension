REAL Live Job Scraper using WebFetch
This script shows how to actually scrape real jobs using Claude Code's WebFetch tool
"""

# To scrape REAL jobs, you need to use the WebFetch tool available in Claude Code

# Example of how to use WebFetch in Claude Code:

"""
1. Use the WebFetch tool with these real URLs:

StepStone:
https://www.stepstone.de/jobs/ai-engineer/in-muenchen

Indeed:
https://de.indeed.com/jobs?q=AI+Engineer&l=M√ºnchen

2. The WebFetch prompt would be:

For StepStone:
"Extract all job listings from this StepStone search page. For each job, get:
- Job title
- Company name
- Location
- Salary if shown
- Posted date
- The actual job URL
Return as JSON array"

3. In Claude Code, you would see WebFetch being called like:
<webfetch url="https://www.stepstone.de/jobs/ai-engineer/in-muenchen" prompt="Extract job listings...">

4. This would return REAL job data with REAL URLs that you can actually visit.

# Since I cannot make real HTTP requests, here's what you can do:

üö® To get REAL live job data:

Option 1: Ask Claude Code to scrape for you
-----------------------------------------
Say: "Use WebFetch to scrape AI Engineer jobs from https://www.stepstone.de/jobs/ai-engineer/in-muenchen"

Claude Code can then use its WebFetch tool to get real data.

Option 2: Use a Python script with requests
-----------------------------------------
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://www.stepstone.de/jobs/ai-engineer/in-muenchen"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
# Parse the real HTML

Option 3: Use Selenium for dynamic content
-----------------------------------------
from selenium import webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://www.stepstone.de/jobs/ai-engineer/in-muenchen")
# Extract real job data

Option 4: Use job site APIs (if available)
-----------------------------------------
Some sites offer official APIs for job data access.

# What I provided vs Reality:

What I provided:
- Simulated data structure that matches real job sites
- Correct URL patterns
- Realistic company and job combinations
- Working dashboard that can display any data

What you need for real data:
- Actual HTTP requests to job sites
- HTML parsing of real responses  
- Handling of dynamic content
- Rate limiting and respectful scraping
