Based on the video transcript, here's a step-by-step process to write LinkedIn posts that get views, as explained by the speaker who achieved 30 million views:

The speaker emphasizes that most LinkedIn posts fail due to: boring insights, unoriginal ideas, standard hooks, unclear structure/format, and uninteresting copy. To succeed, you need to reverse engineer these elements:

1. Find a Core Insight (Step 1)

What it is: A unique, fresh, and interesting perspective. Avoid copying others to build a personal brand.

How to find it:
* Talk to your audience: Analyze questions they ask, problems they have, or dreams/objectives they want to achieve.
* Build in public: Take notes of your daily activities, experiments, events, or anything you're trying.
* Analyze your backstory: Your personal story is unique; find important and interesting points from your past.

2. Find a Main Idea/Angle (Step 2)

Key Rule: One post equals one idea. Don't try to cover too many different ideas in one post, or you'll lose attention.

How to do it: Take your core insight and give it a specific angle, like a journalist. For example, if your audience has a problem, explain a story about that problem.

3. Use a Good Structure and Format (Step 3)

Hard Truth: People don't read your posts; they skim. They look at the overall structure, important sentences, or bullet points.

Why it matters: A good structure increases retention (more time spent, more impressions). A hard-to-read structure makes people leave.

Examples of structures: Carousels, infographics, Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS), Storytelling, Before-After-Bridge. (The speaker mentions a free resource in the description for more details on these.)

4. Write a Great Hook (Step 4)

Importance: The hook will "make or break your post." It's the first two lines visible before clicking "view more."

Three Roles of a Hook:
1. Trigger interest: Make people feel "oh, this is interesting, I want to know more."
2. Tell what the post is about: Clearly state the topic.
3. Make the reader feel concerned: They need to understand it's about *them* and they can use the information.

Advice for Hooks:
* Use numbers to make it specific.
* Talk directly to your audience.
* State a problem and agitate it (PAS framework).
* Share a surprising fact or idea.

5. Deliver the Promise/Content (The Body) (Step 5)

What to do:
* Respect the structure you chose.
* Answer the hook and deliver what you promised.
* Ensure sentences are simple and easy to read, avoiding complex words.
* Maintain good formatting.

Ending: Conclude with a call to action, such as asking a question about what they think or a specific question related to the insight.

Bonus Step: Add an Image

Why: We live in a visual world; images attract and retain attention.

Types of visuals: Infographics, graphs, charts, simple pictures of yourself, screenshots.

Pro Tip: Adding a title to your image can also serve as a hook.

By following these steps, you can create engaging LinkedIn content that resonates with your audience and generates significant views.
