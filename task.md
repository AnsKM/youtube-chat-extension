I need you to improve the markdown formatting in the YouTube Chat Extension to make the chat
  interface more vibrant and engaging. The extension currently has very basic formatting that only
  supports bold text, line breaks, and basic lists.

  Current Issues:

- Plain numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) with no visual distinction
- Basic bullet points using asterisks with no styling
- Minimal text formatting (only bold with **text**)
- No color variation or visual hierarchy
- Lack of spacing between elements
- No emojis enhancements or visual elements

  Requirements:

1. Keep everything else in the app the same - only enhance text formatting
2. Make the chat more vibrant and engaging
3. Improve visual hierarchy
4. Add better markdown parsing support

  Files to Modify:

1. content/content-script-smart.js - Update the formatMessage() function (around line 419) to
   support:
   - Headers (H1-H6) with #, ##, etc.
   - Ordered lists with proper numbered badges
   - Unordered lists with styled bullets
   - Code blocks with ``` syntax and language support
   - Inline code with backticks
   - Task lists - [ ] and - [x]
   - Blockquotes with >
   - Horizontal rules with ---
   - Links [text](url)
   - Text highlighting with ==text==
   - Colored text with custom syntax {color:text} (support red, blue, green, purple, orange, pink)
   - Enhanced emoji detection
   - Keyboard shortcuts with [[Ctrl+S]] syntax
2. content/styles.css - Add new CSS classes after line 304 for:
   - Gradient headers (H1 with gradient text and ðŸ“Œ icon, H2 with purple and â–¸ arrow)
   - Animated list bullets (gradient dots that glow on hover)
   - Numbered lists with circular gradient badges
   - Dark-themed code blocks (#1e293b background) with language labels
   - Stylized blockquotes with purple gradient border
   - Interactive task lists with custom checkboxes
   - Enhanced typography and spacing
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects
   - New color variables: --accent-purple: #8b5cf6, --accent-pink: #ec4899, --accent-orange:
   #f97316, --accent-teal: #14b8a6

  Expected Result:

  Transform plain markdown text into visually engaging content with:

- Colorful, animated list items
- Gradient headers with icons
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Interactive elements
- Better visual hierarchy
- Smooth animations and transitions

  Example Enhancement:

  Before: 1. First itemAfter: A numbered item with a gradient-filled circular badge containing "1",
  with hover animation

  Before: * Bullet pointAfter: A bullet point with an animated gradient dot that glows on hover

  The goal is to make the chat experience more vibrant and engaging while maintaining the clean,
  minimal design aesthetic of the extension.
