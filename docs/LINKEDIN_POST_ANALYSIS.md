# LinkedIn Post Best Practices Analysis

Based on the video "How I write LinkedIn Posts that get 100,000+ views" by a creator with 30M LinkedIn views.

## The 5-Step Framework

### Step 1: Find Unique Insights
**Sources for insights:**
- **Client conversations**: Analyze questions, problems, dreams they share
- **Build in public**: Document daily experiments and events
- **Personal backstory**: Mine your unique experiences

### Step 2: One Post = One Idea
- Act like a journalist - give your insight a specific angle
- Never mix multiple ideas in one post
- Example: If someone shares a problem, tell a story about that specific problem

### Step 3: Structure & Format
**Key truth**: People don't read, they skim
- Use clear visual structure
- Include bullet points
- Make it scannable

**Proven frameworks:**
- Problem → Agitate → Solution (PAS)
- Storytelling framework
- Before → After → Bridge
- Carousels and infographics
- Lists and numbered points

### Step 4: Write a Killer Hook (First 2 lines)
**The hook must:**
1. Trigger interest ("I want to know more")
2. Clearly state what the post is about
3. Make readers feel it's about THEM

**Hook Examples from 100K+ view posts:**
- "In 2022 I started posting short form content. In 2023 I added long form. This happened:"
- "Great marketing is rooted in silent groundwork: • Deep market research • Precise knowledge..."
- "I don't: Live in San Francisco / Have raised funds / Got a big exit"
- "21 B2B marketing tactics for 2024:" [with infographic]
- "Most founders lack clarity on marketing problems" [with visual]

**Hook techniques:**
- Use specific numbers
- Talk directly to audience
- State and agitate a problem
- Share surprising facts

### Step 5: Deliver the Promise (Body)
- Respect your chosen structure
- Answer what you promised in the hook
- Use simple sentences and words
- Format for skimming
- End with a question to drive engagement

### Bonus Step: Add Visuals
- Infographics
- Charts/graphs
- Personal photos
- Screenshots with titles
- Visual hooks complement text hooks

## Key Success Principles

1. **Avoid commodity content** - Don't write what everyone else writes
2. **Personal > Generic** - Your unique perspective matters
3. **Clarity > Cleverness** - Simple language wins
4. **Visual + Text** - Combine for maximum impact
5. **Engagement drivers** - End with genuine questions

## What Makes Posts Fail

1. Boring, non-unique insights
2. Standard, predictable hooks
3. Poor structure/formatting
4. Complex, hard-to-read copy
5. Trying to cover too many ideas

## Implementation for Content Repurposing

When transforming YouTube transcripts to LinkedIn posts:

1. **Extract the ONE core insight** from the video
2. **Choose appropriate framework** based on content type
3. **Craft hook using proven formulas**
4. **Structure for skimming** with short paragraphs
5. **Add visual element** when possible
6. **End with engagement question**
