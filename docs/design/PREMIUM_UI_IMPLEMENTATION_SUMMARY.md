## üéØ Key Design Decisions

1. **Performance First**: Used CSS transforms and will-change for 60fps animations
2. **Accessibility**: Maintained high contrast ratios and focus indicators
3. **Consistency**: Unified transition timing and easing functions
4. **Delight**: Added subtle details like shimmer effects and micro-interactions

## üìä Before vs After

### Before
- Flat design with basic colors
- Standard shadows
- Basic hover states
- Functional but plain

### After

- Dynamic gradients
- Rich micro-interactions
- Premium, memorable experience

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Used transform and opacity for animations
2. **Reduced Repaints**: Avoided animating layout properties
3. **Selective Transitions**: Disabled transitions on frequently updating elements
