# Console Error Analysis - June 8, 2025

## Main Issue Found: Fullscreen State Overwriting

### The Problem
The console logs revealed the issue:
```
YouTube fullscreen state changed: true
Hiding for fullscreen. Was visible: true
Standard fullscreen change detected
Hiding for fullscreen. Was visible: false  <-- State overwritten!
...
Restoring from fullscreen. Was visible before: false  <-- Wrong state!
```

The fullscreen event was firing twice:
1. YouTube-specific detection (correct state saved)
2. Standard fullscreen API (overwrites with wrong state)

### The Fix
Added a flag `isInFullscreen` to prevent state from being overwritten:
```javascript
hideForFullscreen() {
  // Only save state if we haven't already saved it
  if (!this.isInFullscreen) {
    this.wasVisibleBeforeFullscreen = this.chatUI.classList.contains('visible');
    this.wasMinimizedBeforeFullscreen = this.chatUI.classList.contains('minimized');
  }
  this.isInFullscreen = true;
  // ... rest of code
}
```

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: The fullscreen restoration bug was caused by duplicate event handling
❌ **Not Our Issues**: The other console errors are from YouTube and other extensions

## Testing the Fix

1. Load `youtube-chat-extension-v3-fixed.zip`
2. Open chat on YouTube
3. Press F for fullscreen
4. Press F to exit
5. Chat should now restore properly!

Look for these console messages:
- "Saving state before fullscreen. Was visible: true" (only once)
- "Restoring from fullscreen. Was visible before: true"
- "Restoring chat visibility"
