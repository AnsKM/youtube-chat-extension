Hey there! This video is packed with exciting opportunities! The hosts discuss several types of startup ideas that are now viable thanks to advancements in AI.

Here's a breakdown of the key areas they highlight:

AI Infrastructure and Tooling: This includes building the foundational tools for deploying AI and using agents [0:06, 32:13, 32:25]. They mention how ML Ops and ML tools, once difficult to sell, are now in high demand because AI actually works [32:37].
AI-Powered Recruiting and Evaluation: Startups that leverage AI to evaluate human skills for hiring, especially in fields like software engineering. This significantly streamlines the process and allows for expansion into various types of knowledge work [1:20, 2:45, 3:32]. An example given is AI agents for technical interview screening [6:22].
Hyper-Personalized Education (EdTech): AI can finally deliver on the long-held dream of truly personalized learning and tutoring [7:36, 8:18]. This includes AI-driven exam prep [8:35] and tools for teachers to grade assignments [9:02], making education more efficient and tailored.
"Full-Stack" Companies / Tech-Enabled Services: This is about businesses where AI agents can automate the operational or "human" components that previously made these models difficult to scale or unprofitable. Think AI-powered law firms or virtual assistant marketplaces [25:15, 30:08, 31:22].

They also briefly touch on new AI-first platforms, like an "AI-first vibe coding blog platform" [24:53, 25:01], and foundational technologies like advanced speech-to-text for voice agents [36:34].

Which of these areas sounds most interesting to you? We could dive deeper into any of them!
