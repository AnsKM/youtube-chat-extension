## ðŸŽ¯ Claude Prompt for Analyzing Reddit Posts

### Master Prompt Template

```
You're helping me build Reddit karma by crafting authentic, helpful responses. Here are screenshots from [SUBREDDIT_NAME].

CONTEXT ABOUT ME:
- I'm a developer who just built a YouTube learning tool (Chrome extension)
- I'm genuinely interested in productivity, studying, and EdTech
- I watch tons of YouTube tutorials and educational content
- I've struggled with long lectures and information overload
- I'm NOT promoting anything - just building reputation

ANALYZE THE POST:
1. What's the core problem/question?
2. What's the emotional state of the poster?
3. What subreddit culture clues can you spot?
4. Any memes, inside jokes, or references to understand?
5. Recent relevant news/trends that relate?

CRAFT A RESPONSE THAT:
- Directly helps with their specific issue
- Includes a personal anecdote if relevant
- Makes a subtle joke or reference if appropriate
- Asks a follow-up question to engage further
- Feels like it's from a real person, not AI
- NEVER mentions my extension unless directly relevant and asked

PERSONALITY GUIDELINES:
- Be like that helpful classmate who actually did the reading
- Mix proper grammar with casual internet speak
- Sound educated but not condescending
- Add personality quirks: maybe you drink too much coffee, or you're a night owl, or you have a cat that sits on your keyboard
- Reference current events, memes, or pop culture when fitting

Give me 3 response options:
1. Helpful & Straightforward
2. Helpful with Humor
3. Ultra-engaged (for posts that really resonate)
