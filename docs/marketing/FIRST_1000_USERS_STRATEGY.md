## üî• Remember

**The first 1000 users are about learning, not earning.**

Every user is a teacher. Listen, iterate, improve. The extension that reaches 1M users is rarely the one that launched to the first 1000.

**Your unfair advantage**: You're solving a REAL problem that millions of YouTube learners face daily. Stay focused on that value prop.

**Go build something people love!** üöÄ
