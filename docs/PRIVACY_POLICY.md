# Privacy Policy - YouTube Chat AI Extension

Last Updated: June 8, 2025

## Overview

YouTube Chat AI ("the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our Chrome extension handles information when you use it.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect any personal information.**

The extension:
- Does NOT collect personally identifiable information
- Does NOT track your browsing history
- Does NOT collect analytics or usage data
- Does NOT store data on external servers
- Does NOT sell or share any user data

## How the Extension Works

1. **Local Storage Only**: All your chat conversations are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This data never leaves your device.

2. **API Communication**: When you ask a question about a YouTube video, the extension sends only the video transcript and your question to Google's Gemini API to generate a response. No personal information is included in these requests.

3. **API Key**: Your Gemini API key is stored encrypted in your browser's local storage and is never transmitted anywhere except to Google's Gemini API for authentication.

## Data Storage

- **Chat History**: Stored locally in your browser
- **Settings**: Stored locally in your browser
- **API Key**: Encrypted and stored locally in your browser

You can delete all stored data at any time by:
1. Removing the extension
2. Clearing your browser's storage
3. Using the extension's clear chat feature

## Third-Party Services

The extension uses Google's Gemini API for AI responses. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for information about how Google handles data.

## Permissions

The extension requires certain permissions to function:
- **Storage**: To save your conversations and settings locally
- **Active Tab**: To detect YouTube videos and inject the chat interface
- **Host Permissions**: To communicate with YouTube and Google's APIs

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access your data (it's all stored locally in your browser)
- Delete your data (remove the extension or clear storage)
- Opt-out (simply don't use the extension)

Remember: **We don't collect data, so there's nothing to request or delete from our servers because we don't have any!**
