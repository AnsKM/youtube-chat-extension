# Test Content for Fixed Issues

## 1. Find a Core Insight (Step 1)

What it is: A unique, fresh, and interesting perspective. Avoid copying others to build a personal brand.

How to find it:

* Talk to your audience: Analyze questions they ask, problems they have, or dreams/objectives they want to achieve.
* Build in public: Take notes of your daily activities, experiments, events, or anything you're trying.

## Three Roles of a Hook:

1. Trigger interest: Make people feel "oh, this is interesting, I want to know more."
2. Tell what the post is about: Clearly state the topic.
3. Make the reader feel concerned: They need to understand it's about *them* and they can use the information.

## 5. Deliver the Promise/Content (The Body) (Step 5)

What to do:

* Respect the structure you chose.
* Answer the hook and deliver what you promised.
* Ensure sentences are simple and easy to read, avoiding complex words.
* Maintain good formatting.
