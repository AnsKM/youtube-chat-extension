## 💰 Cost Optimization

### How It Works

The Smart Query Router automatically optimizes costs based on:

1. **Video Length Detection**
   - Short videos (<30 min): Direct caching for instant responses
   - Medium videos (30-180 min): Smart RAG for 85-90% savings
   - Long videos (>3 hours): Aggressive RAG for 95%+ savings

2. **Query Classification**
   - Timestamp queries: Fetches only relevant segments
   - Summary queries: Uses efficient summarization strategies
   - Specific queries: Targets exact information needed

3. **Context Caching**
   - Gemini's context caching provides 75% additional savings
   - Frequently accessed segments are cached automatically
   - Cache persists for 30 minutes per video segment

### Cost Breakdown

| Video Length | Without Optimization | With Smart Router | Savings |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 10 minutes   | $0.03               | $0.0075           | 75%      |
| 1 hour       | $0.15               | $0.015            | 90%      |
| 3+ hours     | $0.50+              | $0.025            | 95%+     |

## 🗺️ Architecture

### Smart Query Router System

The extension uses a sophisticated routing system to minimize costs:

```javascript
// Automatic strategy selection based on video length
if (videoLength < 30) {
  // Direct caching with 75% savings
  strategy = 'DIRECT_CACHE';
} else if (videoLength < 180) {
  // Smart RAG with 85-90% savings
  strategy = 'SMART_RAG';
} else {
  // Aggressive optimization for 95%+ savings
  strategy = 'AGGRESSIVE_RAG';
}
```

### Console Debugging

Enable detailed logging to see the router in action:
```javascript
// In Developer Console (F12)
window.DEBUG_SMART_ROUTER = true;
```

You'll see:
- Video analysis and token counts
- Query classification results
- Strategy selection reasoning
- Cost calculations and savings
- Cache hit/miss statistics

## 🔧 Connection Fixes

### Issue: Subsequent Questions Not Working

If you experience issues where the first question works but subsequent questions fail, this has been resolved with the following improvements:

#### ✅ Connection Issues Fixed:
1. **Service Worker Lifecycle** - Chrome service workers become inactive after 30 seconds
2. **Connection Health Monitoring** - Automatic detection of connection loss
3. **Retry Logic** - Exponential backoff retry for failed requests
4. **UI State Management** - Proper input field enabling/disabling
5. **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of connection errors

## ⏱️ Timestamp Validation Fixes

### Issue: Hallucinated/Invalid Timestamps

The AI was generating timestamps that don't exist in the actual video (e.g., [15:30] for an 11-minute video).

#### ✅ Timestamp Issues Fixed:
1. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering** - AI receives explicit video duration constraints
2. **Multi-Layer Validation** - Timestamps validated against video duration and transcript
3. **Intelligent Replacement** - Invalid timestamps become descriptive text ("early in the video")
4. **Transcript Integration** - Only timestamps from actual transcript are referenced
5. **Visual Feedback** - Users see when invalid timestamps are detected and replaced

#### 🎯 How It Works:
- **Before**: AI generates `[15:30]` for 11-minute video ❌
- **After**: AI uses `"around the middle"` or actual transcript timestamps ✅

#### 🔍 Testing the Timestamp Fixes:

Load the test script in browser console on any YouTube video:
```javascript
// Copy and paste test-timestamp-validation.js into console, then run:
runTimestampValidationTests()
```

#### 🔍 Testing the Connection Fixes:

Load the test script in your browser console on any YouTube video page:
```javascript
// Copy and paste test-connection-fix.js into console, then run:
runAllTests()
```

#### 📊 Connection Status Indicator:
- 🟢 **Green dot**: Connected and ready
- 🟡 **Yellow dot**: Attempting to reconnect  
- 🔴 **Red dot**: Connection lost

#### 🛠️ Manual Testing:
1. Ask a question and wait for response
2. Wait 30+ seconds, then ask another question
3. Reload the extension and test again
4. Try rapid-fire questions to test race condition handling

#### 🐛 If Issues Persist:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Gemini API key is set correctly
3. Refresh the YouTube page
4. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
